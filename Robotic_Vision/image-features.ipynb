        "SIFT is very powerful (it has the very useful property called scale-invariance which we won't have time to cover) but was [patented by the University of British Columbia](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6711293) and researchers were therefore reluctant to be too dependent on it. [SURF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features) was  developed by Herbert Bay, Tinne Tuytelaars, and Luc Van Gool and published in 2006. It has similar functionality to SIFT but is much faster.  It turns out that [SURF was also patented](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/036954920/publication/US2009238460A1?q=pn%3DUS2009238460) but people seemed to worry less about that.  Now the SIFT patent has expired so it is back in favour.  OpenCV ships with SIFT but not SURF."
